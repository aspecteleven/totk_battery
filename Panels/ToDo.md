Panel 7 - Fix scaling and movements

LAST - After user enters their name, the option for "Continue" is added, above "New Game" on Panel 1
-- "New Game" will clear the user's name, and show the whole storyboard again, asking for the user's name etc.
-- "Continue" will skip Panels 2 through 9, and just go to Panel 10 (the controls)

Panel 10 - Have "helper" modals on Panel 10 that point out what to do in order, and explain the interface, as a walkthrough. Only display the walkthrough the first time the user is on the page (but also have an "i" in a circle icon at the bottom left of the panel, that, when clicked on, will go through the walkthrough again.)
