1 - Devise a simple story for Panel 2

2A - Split Link from backgrounds, so can do fade & shrink/grow "walk" (3-step each time), like he is walking toward or away. Timed event, no clicking needed. (panels )
2B - Add fade in and deblur to panel6_blessing_text image, then delay 3 seconds, then fade out and blur the panel6_blessing_text image1 second afer that completes,  have Link "walk forward" 

3 - Refine box-shadows/text-shadows - Panel 1, Panel 6
4 - Add Purah explainer panel (Panel 9) (how to connect the device, with blue instruction screens, like the controls screen)

LAST - After user enters their name, the option for "Continue" is added, above "New Game" on Panel 1
-- "New Game" will clear the user's name, and show the whole storyboard again, asking for the user's name etc.
-- "Continue" will skip Panels 2 through 9, and just go to Panel 10 (the controls)
