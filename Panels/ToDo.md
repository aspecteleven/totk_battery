Panel 7 - Fix scaling and movements

LAST - After user enters their name, the option for "Continue" is added, above "New Game" on Panel 1
-- "New Game" will clear the user's name, and show the whole storyboard again, asking for the user's name etc.
-- "Continue" will skip right to Panel 10 (the controls)

Panel 10 - Have "helper" modals on Panel 10 that point out what to do in order, and explain the interface, as a walkthrough. Only display the walkthrough the first time the user is on the page (but also have an "i" in a circle icon at the bottom left of the panel, that, when clicked on, will go through the walkthrough again.)

Confirm there is no longer need for the original index.html, styles.css, and main.js, as it should all have been integrated into Panel 10.

Ensure WEBP images are being used for all images, instead of PNGs.

Clean up panel numbering; finalize the project and move to the main folder and rename panels.html to index.html

Outside of the coding, create a simple card for how to get to the GitHub Code Page, before the present is opened.
